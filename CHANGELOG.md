# tullaCTC Version History

## v2.0.0 (Unreleased)

* Added support for Midnight. During combat, tullaCTC will attempt
  to determine cooldown durations by parsing the actual text
  of the cooldown. This isn't as accurate (especially for cooldowns
  with mod rates), but its a fairly good heruistic for this
  particular addon.
